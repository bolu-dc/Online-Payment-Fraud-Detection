# Online Payment Fraud Detection

Every financial institution is vulnerable to fraud. To lessen the impact of fraud in these organizations, it is crucial to have controls in place. One of the most reliable techniques for combating fraud in the financial sector is machine learning, which is used in this initiative.

This project's goal is to predict online fraudulent transactions using the Blossom Bank's transactionÂ glossary. To accomplish the goals, the data set was first carefully examined, cleansed, and subjected to exploratory data analysis to help better understand the data set.

The following machine learning algorithms were used to understand the patterns of the clients and make accurate predictions:
  - Logistic Regression.
  - K-Neighbors Classifiers.
  - Decision Tree Classifier.
  - Random Forest Classifier.
